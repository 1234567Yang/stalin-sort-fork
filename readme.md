## Want to help? :star:

We're accepiting help from anyone! This repo is collaborative, so if you want to add a solution in a new language (check Wikipedia [Programming Language

List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages)) or just improve some code that you think that can be improved, follow this steps:

  

### 1. Fork it :fork_and_knife:

  

You can get your own fork/copy of [Stalin Sort](https://github.com/gustavo-depaula/stalin-sort) by using the <a  href="https://github.com/Hacktoberfest-2018/Hello-world/new/master?readme=1#fork-destination-box"><kbd><b>Fork</b></kbd></a> button or clicking [this](https://github.com/gustavo-depaula/stalin-sort/new/master?readme=1#fork-destination-box).

### 2. Start coding! :rabbit2:

Once you have forked the repo, add your program in the language folder in

main branch, if there is no language folder, make one, then add into it.

  

For a PR to be approved and merged please note

- we allow more than one solution for one language, so if you don't want to modify someones code, you can add a new file with your own solution. Have in mind that your solution must be completely unique, if it isn't consider modify the existing code.

- we allow maximum of 5000 additions (your PR will get close if its exceeds, but you can ask maintainer for reviewing this)

- we dont allow deletions of others files or code.

- we dont allow files to be directly added in root directory of project, add them in there language folder

### 3. Ready, Steady, Go... :turtle: :rabbit2:
